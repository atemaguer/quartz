Hi! I’m Atem Aguer, a student studying computer science at Stanford.

Welcome to my blog where I hope to explore my curiosities, document my learnings, and practice my writing. I’ve broad and varied interests spanning technology and startups, physics, football(soccer), AI, among many other things.

In the past, I’ve built marketplace applications and infrastructure for a startup during my gap year after high school, was an early intern at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) during [DeFi summer](https://wiki.rugdoc.io/docs/defi-summer-definition/), researched NLP and information retrieval systems at [Stanford Future Data Systems](http://www.futuredata.io.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) under the guidance of [Omar Khattab](https://omarkhattab.com/), [Keshav Santhanam](https://cs.stanford.edu/~keshav2/) and [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/), and worked on distributed storage infrastructure at DoorDash.

In my spare time, I hack on open-source projects, play football, light weights, and hike.

You can get in touch with me through [email](mailto:atemjohn@stanford.edu) or [twitter](https://x.com/leithnyang).

Also, my past technical work can be found [here](https://github.com/atemaguer).
