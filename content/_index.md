Hi! I’m Atem Aguer. I previously studied at Stanford where I recieved my BS & MS in Computer Science concentrating in AI and computer systems.

I’ve broad and varied interests spanning technology and startups, Fútbol (GGMU), AI, among many other things.

In the past, I was a founding full-stack engineer (mobile & web) for a startup during my gap year after high school, was an early intern at [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com) during [DeFi summer](https://wiki.rugdoc.io/docs/defi-summer-definition/), researched NLP, Information Retrieval, and distributed systems at [Stanford Future Data Systems](http://www.futuredata.io.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/) under the guidance of [Omar Khattab](https://omarkhattab.com/), [Keshav Santhanam](https://cs.stanford.edu/~keshav2/) and [Matei Zaharia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~matei/), worked on distributed storage infrastructure at DoorDash, and led AI engineering efforts at Codegen, an early coding agents startup.

In my spare time, I hack on open-source projects, play soccer, lift weights, take long walks, and watch TV shows.

You can get in touch with me through [email](mailto:atemjohn@stanford.edu) or [twitter](https://x.com/leithnyang).
